ðŸ“Š Advanced Statistics for Data Science Interviews 

Welcome to my comprehensive Advanced Statistics project designed specifically for Data Science, Analytics, and Machine Learning interview preparation.
This repository contains 50+ in-depth questions and answers covering both theoretical understanding and hands-on implementation using Python.

ðŸ§  Topics Covered
ðŸ”¹ Probability & Distributions
Random Variables, PDF, and CDF

Discrete Distributions: Bernoulli, Poisson, Discrete Uniform

Continuous Distributions: Normal, Standard Normal, Continuous Uniform

Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

Z-statistics and its application

ðŸ”¹ Statistical Inference & Hypothesis Testing
Confidence Intervals, Margin of Error

P-value and Significance Levels

Hypothesis Testing: Z-Test, T-Test

Type I and Type II Errors

Z-Test vs T-Test (when to use each)

ðŸ”¹ Advanced Statistical Testing
Bayesâ€™ Theorem and conditional probability

Chi-Square Distribution:

Goodness of Fit

Test of Independence

F-Distribution and F-Variance Ratio Test

ANOVA (One-way & Two-way) and its assumptions

ðŸ§ª Implementation Highlights
All statistical concepts are implemented using Python, including:

NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation
